Act as a Senior UI/UX Engineer. I need you to completely refactor the current page design.

Analyze the current file to detect the framework and styling method being used. Apply the following design changes using the existing tech stack.

**The Goal:**
Transform this page from a "dashboard" look into a premium "Focused Wizard" onboarding experience (similar to the initial setup screens of Linear, Vercel, or ChatGPT).

**Specific Design Instructions:**

1.  **Layout Overhaul:**
    * **Remove the Sidebar:** For this specific "Welcome/Setup" view, hide or remove the left navigation sidebar entirely.
    * **Center Focus:** Move all content to the center of the screen in a single column container with a maximum width (approx 600px).
    * **Vertical Alignment:** Center the container vertically in the viewport so it floats in the middle of the white space.

2.  **Typography (Make it Classy):**
    * **Font Family:** Switch ALL text to a clean Sans-Serif font (Inter, system-ui, or similar). Remove any Serif fonts immediately.
    * **Headings:** Make "Brief Personal Anda" large, bold, and tracking-tight (letter-spacing slightly negative).
    * **Subtext:** Make the description ("6 AI bekerja...") smaller and a lighter shade of gray to create visual hierarchy.

3.  **Input Fields (The "Premium" Feel):**
    * **Height & Space:** Increase the height of input fields significantly (make them look "chunky" and touch-friendly).
    * **Borders:** Use very subtle, light gray borders. Add a slight border-radius (rounded corners).
    * **Active State:** When clicking an input, add a soft glow or ring effect so it feels responsive.
    * **Labels:** Place labels distinctly above the inputs with a bold, legible font weight.

4.  **The Main Button:**
    * Make the "Buat Brief Saya" button the star of the page.
    * **Style:** Solid Black background (or very dark gray) with White text.
    * **Shape:** Rounded corners (pill or rounded-lg).
    * **Width:** Make it full-width to match the input fields.

5.  **Content:**
    * Keep all existing input fields and placeholders exactly as they are. just change the styling and layout.
